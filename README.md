## Oystercard

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

## Motivation
By the end of the week all developers can:

Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
